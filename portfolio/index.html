<h3><a href="http://cbflooringinc.com">CbFlooringInc</a></h3>
<p>I started building this project little by little approximately on April 2nd.
  It is a web site and also web app for my brother's business. If you just visit the page you will be able to see the customer side of it. But if you want to see the admin side of it you will have to checkout the code on: <a class="contact-link" href="https://github.com/alexcodreanu86/cb_flooring_production"><i class="fa fa-github fa-3x"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Until I change this paragraph the website is still under construction.</p>

<h3><a href="http://infobyt.es">Infobytes</a></h3>
<p>This project was built in 8 days by a team of 5 people(including me) as the final project at DBC. Infobytes was inspired by the knowledge its creators gained from the internet as fledgling developers and their desire to pay it forward. The web is missing a centralized location for detailed instructions on completing full scale tech projects. Infobytes bridges this gap by offering an easy to use and customizable tutorial publisher, a standardized format, and a rating system that lets users know which tutorials are most useful.</p>

<h3><a href="http://poodle-survey.herokuapp.com/">Survey tool</a></h3>
<p>This project was built in 3 days by a team of 5 people(including me again). We have built a survey tool that facilitates survey creation, participation, and data collection. It is running on heroku so you may have to give it a few seconds to wake up.</p>
